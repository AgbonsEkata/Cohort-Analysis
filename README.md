# Cohort-Analysis


A Cohort analysis is used to understand the behavior of customers you do business with. You do it to see patterns and trends. A cohort is basically a group of people with something in common or common characteristics. A cohort analysis is simply an analysis of several different cohorts to get a better understanding of behaviors, patterns, and trends. 

This project focuses on retention based analysis. Depending on your type of cohort you could have a time-based cohort, segment-based cohort, or a size-based cohort. We are doing a Time-based Cohort where we are looking at the time a certain group of people purchased or had significant activity on our website, and then we can view their behavior after that first instance of activity


The data from the time based cohort will be used to do a retention based analysis. The data from the time based cohort was used to do a retention based analysis which was then visualised in Tableau
